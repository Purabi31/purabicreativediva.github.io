  <div class="columnnew"><h3 class="blog-title">My Role</h3>
	  <p>I was the UX researcher and illustrator designer. In the beginning, I conducted and reviewed findings from our user interviews. Later on, I drew storyboards and helped finalize the design the website app through wireframes and high-fidelity mockups</p></div>
  <div class="columnnew1"><h3 class="blog-title">Challenge</h3><p>Redesign the Joy iOS mobile app to encourage guests to capture the "Joy" that takes place during weddings.</p>

	                	<h3 class="blog-title">Undestanding the Audience</h3>
						<p>Everyone has a mobile phone in their pocket. In addition to standard photos and videos, what are creative things we can do to these media formats to let guests better express the joy they experience at these events?
						How do we encourage guests to capture and share while making it friction-less? How do we make it a fast and fluid experience? For users that don’t create content, how do they engage?</p>

					<h3 class="blog-title">Seeking user feedback</h3>
						<p>We reached out to three different participants to research and gain user feedback for the current Joy app. We wanted to analyze users' pain points within the current Joy experience, and validate ideas that emphasize capturing joy.

						<h3 class="blog-title">Design requirements</h3>
						<p>We wanted to redesign Joy in a positive manner for each end user with an emphasis on capturing and sharing the joy of weddings. In order to get feedback on our ideas from the company mentors, we first outlined some design requirements for the Joy iOS mobile app as a whole.</p>
						
<ul>
 <li>A successful redesign will fit into the visual design language and brand already established.</li>
 <li>Users should know or quickly learn that capturing moments is a primary action used in the app.</li>
 <li>Users should want to capture moments and be encouraged to participate.</li>
<li>Users should feel they are creating unique and creative content to share.</li>
<li>The experience should feel social and human.</li>
<li>Keep in mind the consumption experience for users viewing the content.</li>
<li>Keep in mind how the content is packaged and viewed for years to come.</li>
							
</ul>

  <div class="columnnew2"><h3 class="blog-title">Wirefames</h3>
<p>With the design requirements in mind, we proposed some features and changes to begin "capturing the Joy." As the team's illustrator, I drew storyboards for Joy's target users. We identified four main target users of Joy:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Attending guests</li>
	<li>Brides & grooms</li>
   <li>Guests who could not attend</li>
	<li>Admins – wedding planners, photographers, maids/men of honor</li>
</ul>
<br>
						<p>
Using storyboards, we wanted to envision different scenarios in which the intended users could use Joy - before, during, and after a wedding.</p></div>

<p> appearance of the home page changes depending on whether it's before, during, or after a wedding, to show relevant content during that time.</p>
