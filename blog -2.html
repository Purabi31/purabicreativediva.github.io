						<h3 class="blog-title", "bgcolor">About the Project</h3>
						<p>After the launch of the MyChoice corporate, there was a requirement for the company to build an internal tool to monitor the transactions which take place on the platform. The tool was mainly an AI-based which was used to detect any kind of malicious transaction or any anti-money laundering transaction on the system and the tool was named as " FALCON ".</p>
					
				<div class="row">
  <div class="columnnew"><h3 class="blog-title">My Role</h3>
	  <p>I was the UX researcher and illustrator and photoshop designer. In the beginning, I conducted and reviewed findings from our user and stakeholders interviews.Held regular meetings with the financial team who are going to be end users of this tool we froze up on the flows. Later on, I drew storyboards and helped finalize the redesign of transaction monitoring web app through wireframes and high-fidelity mockups</p></div>
  <div class="columnnew1"><h3 class="blog-title">Challenge</h3><p>Falcon is the software used by the company to meet the legal requirements for financial institutions and other regulated entities to prevent or report money laundering activities. There were multiple aspects of the tools like every time a set of a predefined suspicious transaction is made then an alert is raised and the collection of these alerts is called as an outsorts and when many such outsorts are bundled together then an entity is formed. Typically the person working on the tool is called as an agent and he was given a feasibility to drill from entity level to the individual transaction level but since there were many entities to take care in a day the tool was designed with a basic principle to reduce the number of clicks and has to be limited to only a few pages.</p>

						<p>the users were a set of qualified professionals inside the organizations who were specifically deployed to observe the transactions following on the system using this tool. So, conducting user intervew/and usability test was not challenging for us. </p>

						<h3 class="blog-title">Design process :</h3>
						<p>Initially, when we analyzed the requirement it was almost an impossible task to keep the tool crisp and cut-to-the point. we made initial handmade sketches and made user flows on paper. slowly with regular meetings with the financial team who are going to be end users of this tool we froze up on the flows. </p>
						<p>We were able to get a shape to the requirement given to us but the actual task was still pending that was making the tool crisp and making it as minimal as possible but the tricky part was there were many actions which were to be performed and a lot of information to be displayed on the screen. So we decided to split the screens into 2 halves the first half had the information of the entity and the second half was equipped with the transactions and as well as the outsorts of the entity. We decided to use popups only for major actions and to confirm those actions. 
the biggest challenge was to get the transactions history we had a lot of information to be shown apart from just the amount. so we decided to go with a vertical timeline approach to make record the transactions and use iconography and small tooltips to indicate the actions and show information, and vollah !! soon we could get an amazing tool with all the actions and information shown and as well as at the same time it was made interactive with charts and timeline above all we were able to show all the information just by navigation into 2 pages . 
</p>
<ul>
 <li>A successful redesign will fit into the visual design language and brand already established.</li>
 <li>Users should know or quickly learn that capturing moments is a primary action used in the app.</li>
<li>Keep in mind how the content is packaged and viewed for years to come.</li>
							
</ul>

<p>With the design requirements in mind, we proposed some features and changes to begin "capturing the Joy." As the team's illustrator, I drew storyboards for Joy's target users. We identified four main target users of Joy:</p>

<br>
						<p>
Using storyboards, we wanted to envision different scenarios in which the intended users could use Joy - before, during, and after a wedding.</p></div>

						<h3 class="blog-title">Outcome :</h3>
						<h4>Home page redesign</h4>
<p>soon when the new tool was online the team was comfortable with the new tools and luckily we could reduce the manual work and increase the efficiency of the individual. what I could understand from this project was For the sake of efficiency, going straight from sketches to user flows and hi-fi prototyping is fine as long as you test thoroughly, keeping the visual balance along with the functionality is important but at the same time, we should also focus on solving the problem. Dashboards are usually heavy and filled with a lot of data arranging the data properly and prioritizing it plays a vital role while designing dashboard board for internal team members.</p
